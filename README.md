# backtesting_strategy1
In this mini project, we will be creating a Backtesting model using Monthly Portfolio Rebalancing strategy. For this strategy, we will use multiple DJI(Dow Jones index) constituent stocks. We will use yfinance(to get data from yahoo finances API) python package to get the data of the stocks and then we will calculate the portfolio returns along with the key performance Indicators(KPI's) like CAGR(Cumulative Annual Growth Rate), Volatality, Sharpe ratio, Max drawdown. Finally, we will compare the KPI's of this strategy with that of the simple buy and hold strategy of corresponding index by plotting the graphs of two sets of KPI's in order to check the performance of our strategy.
